# College-Event-Management
The College Event Management System is a simple web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows students to:

View upcoming events with details like name, date, and location.
Register for events by filling in their name, email, and selecting an event from a dropdown.
The webpage is designed with a clean and responsive layout, making it easy for users to navigate and interact. This project can be further enhanced by adding a backend for storing registrations.
